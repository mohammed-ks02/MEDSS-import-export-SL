# Step 1: Codebase Audit and Environment Preparation - COMPLETED

## Summary
This document summarizes the completion of Step 1 of the internationalization setup for the MEDSS Import & Export project.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Codebase Structure Review
- **Project Type**: Astro project with React integration (not Next.js as originally assumed)
- **Current Structure**: The project already has a basic i18n implementation using `data-i18n` attributes and inline JavaScript translations
- **Existing Languages**: English, Spanish, and French translations were already present in `src/components/Header.astro`

### 2. Hard-coded Language Data Identification
Located existing Spanish texts and internationalization infrastructure in:
- `src/components/Header.astro` - Contains comprehensive translations object with EN/ES/FR
- `src/components/sections/Hero.astro` - Already using `data-i18n` attributes
- `src/components/sections/FeaturedProducts.astro` - Partially internationalized
- `src/components/Footer.astro` - Using `data-i18n` attributes

### 3. Dependencies Installation ✅
Successfully installed and configured:
- `i18next` (^25.3.2)
- `react-i18next` (^15.6.1) 
- `i18next-browser-languagedetector` (^8.2.0)

### 4. Locales Directory Structure Created ✅
```
src/locales/
├── es/
│   └── common.json
├── en/
│   └── common.json
└── fr/
    └── common.json
```

### 5. Translation Files Created ✅

#### Spanish (es/common.json) - 6,281 bytes
- Complete Spanish translations extracted from existing codebase
- Covers navigation, footer, hero, about, products, contact, and company information
- 86 translation keys

#### English (en/common.json)
- Complete English translations as baseline/fallback language
- Matches all Spanish translation keys
- 86 translation keys

#### French (fr/common.json) 
- Complete French translations
- Covers same scope as Spanish and English
- 86 translation keys

### 6. i18n Configuration Setup ✅
Created `src/utils/i18n.js` with:
- i18next initialization
- Language detection configuration (localStorage → navigator → htmlTag)
- Resource loading for all three languages
- Fallback language set to English
- Astro/React compatibility settings

## Current State
- ✅ Dependencies installed and configured
- ✅ Translation files created and structured properly
- ✅ Basic i18n infrastructure established
- ✅ Existing Spanish content migrated to JSON format

## Key Findings
1. **Project already had i18n groundwork**: The project had `data-i18n` attributes and translation objects, making this step easier
2. **Comprehensive Spanish content**: Rich Spanish translations covering all major sections of the website
3. **Astro framework**: Using Astro instead of Next.js, which affects the implementation approach
4. **Three-language support**: English, Spanish, and French are all supported

## Next Steps (for subsequent steps)
- Refactor existing inline translation system to use i18next
- Update components to use the new translation system
- Implement proper language switching functionality
- Test and validate all translations

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/locales/es/common.json` (NEW)
- `src/locales/en/common.json` (NEW)  
- `src/locales/fr/common.json` (NEW)
- `src/utils/i18n.js` (NEW)
- `package.json` (MODIFIED - dependencies added)

**Step 1 Status: ✅ COMPLETED**
